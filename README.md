# password-checker-have-i-been-pwned

This project was created as part of the Zero to Mastery Complete Python Developer Course. Additional functionality beyond what was done in the course includes storing the passwords in a text file instead of entering them at the command line.


# Usage

Use this program from the command line as follows:

python password_checker.py [enter_name_passwords_file].txt

This program will check each password in the specified text file against the haveibeenpwned.com database to see if any of the passwords have been compromised in any data breaches. Make sure each password is on a separate line in the text file.
